- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m SHRINEDHI.M.R. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web developement
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m  diving into the MEAN and MERN 
  stacks to broaden my skills in full-stack development.
  Exploring these technologies to create robust and dynamic web applications is my current focus.
  
This repository contains a collection of my small projects related to HTML/CSS and front-end development.
   These projects are a showcase of my learning journey and experiments in web development.


   
  Feel free to explore the projects in this repository and reach out if you have any questions
  or ideas to share! Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are always welcome.
   Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
